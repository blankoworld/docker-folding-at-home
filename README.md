### Short description

Gives some files to build a container (with Docker software) with Ubuntu 12.04 and FAHClient service to be a part to Folding@Home.

### How to use my own login and team for the FAHClient container?

It simple: just edit the **config.xml** with your own element.

### Notes

For now, I attempt to make webpanel available from the guest to the host, without results. If anyone know how to proceed, I'm interested.
